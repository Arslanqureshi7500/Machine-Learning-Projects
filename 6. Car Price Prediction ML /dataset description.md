# Car Price Prediction Project

## Problem Statement

A Chinese automobile company, **Geely Auto**, aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to compete with their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to explore the variables that influence car pricing in the American market, as these factors may differ significantly from those in the Chinese market.

The company aims to understand:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
- How well those variables describe the price of a car

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market.

## Business Goal

We are required to model the **price of cars** using the available independent variables. This model will help management understand how car prices vary with different factors. Based on these insights, they can strategically:

- Adjust car designs
- Modify business strategies
- Align pricing with market expectations

The predictive model will also provide a solid foundation for understanding the pricing dynamics in a new market environment.
