Ever wondered how much your dream home is worth? We did too! I harnessed the power of machine learning to predict the prices of apartments and houses across the USA.



𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘄𝗲 𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁:



𝟭. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: We brought the data to life with interactive dashboards, uncovering hidden patterns and trends.

𝟮. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀: We dug deep into the data, identifying key factors that influence housing prices.

𝟯. 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴: We refined the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

𝟰. 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: We trained our machine learning model, feeding it a wealth of information.

𝟱. 𝗠𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: We deployed Linear Regression, a robust algorithm for predicting continuous outcomes.

𝟲. 𝗟𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗥𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: We put our model to the test, assessing its performance with accuracy_score, precision, and recall.



The result? A predictive model that can estimate housing prices with remarkable accuracy!
