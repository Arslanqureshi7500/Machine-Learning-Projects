🚀 𝗕𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿-𝗙𝗿𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗹𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁: 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗹-𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗖𝗮𝗿 & 𝗣𝗲𝗱𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻! 🚗🚶‍♂️

Ever wondered:
🤔 “𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙙𝙤 𝙨𝙚𝙡𝙛-𝙙𝙧𝙞𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙘𝙖𝙧𝙨 𝙠𝙣𝙤𝙬 𝙬𝙝𝙚𝙣 𝙩𝙤 𝙨𝙩𝙤𝙥 𝙛𝙤𝙧 𝙖 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙤𝙣?”
🤔 “𝙃𝙤𝙬 𝙙𝙤 𝙨𝙢𝙖𝙧𝙩 𝙘𝙖𝙢𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙨 𝙩𝙧𝙖𝙘𝙠 𝙢𝙤𝙫𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙫𝙚𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙡𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙧𝙤𝙖𝙙?”

In this simple yet exciting project, I explored Computer Vision — teaching my computer to "see" and detect cars 🚗 and pedestrians 🚶‍♂️ in a live video!

🎥 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸?
✅ A video of a busy street (cars & people) is fed into the program.
✅ I used pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifiers to help the computer understand what cars and people look like.
✅ The program reads video frame-by-frame...
✅ And draws colorful boxes 📦 around detected cars and pedestrians — in real time!
✅ The display window is resized to optimize performance.

🎯 𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁?
I wanted to practically understand how Computer Vision can be used in:
✔️ Self-driving car technology 🚘
✔️ Smart traffic systems 🚦
✔️ Surveillance & safety applications 🔍

🛠️ 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗲𝗱:
🔹 Python
🔹 OpenCV (for Computer Vision)
🔹 Pre-trained Haar Cascade models
🔹 Real-time video processing logic

Learning how machines "see" the world is super exciting — this is just one small step towards building smarter AI systems! 🚀
